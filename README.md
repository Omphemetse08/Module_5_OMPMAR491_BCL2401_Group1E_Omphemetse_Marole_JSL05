# The code creates playlists for different characters based on their favorite music genre.

# What's inside the Code.

- Songs: There's a big list of songs with information like title, artist, and genre.
- Guardians: These are the characters (like Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy) and their favorite genre.
- Playlist Generator: This is the special function that creates playlists. It checks each guardian's favorite genre and finds matching songs from the big list.

# How it works.

1. The code goes through each guardian one by one.
2. It finds what kind of music that guardian likes (Pop,Classic Rock,80s Pop,Heavy Metal).
3. Then it searches through all the songs and picks only the ones that matches the guardian's favorite genre.
4. Finally, it creates a special list for each guardian showing their favorite songs.

# What you can see.

- When you open the code i a web browser, you will see playlists for each guardian with their songs listed
- If the guardian doesn't have any song in their favorite genre, it will show the message letting you know you dont have any song on the playlist.

# What you can add.

- You can easily add more songs to the list by following the same format (title, artist, genre).
- you can also add more guardian and their genres.
